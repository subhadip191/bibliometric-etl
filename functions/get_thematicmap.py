    Generate a thematic map from the specified field in the DataFrame.

    Args:
        df: A DataFrame object containing the data.
        field: The field from which to extract terms.
        n: The number of terms to display.
        minfreq: Minimum frequency of terms to include.
        ngrams: The number of n-grams to extract.
        stemming: Whether to apply stemming.
        size: Size of the nodes in the graph.
        n_labels: Number of labels to display.
        community_repulsion: Repulsion factor for community detection.
        repel: Whether to apply repulsion in the graph layout.
        remove_terms: Terms to remove from the text.
        synonyms: Synonyms to merge into a single term.
        cluster: Clustering algorithm to use (e.g., "walktrap", "louvain").
