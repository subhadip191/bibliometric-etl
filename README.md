## Overview

**bibliometrix-python** is a Python implementation of the renowned **bibliometrix** R package, providing a comprehensive set of tools for quantitative research in bibliometrics and scientometrics.

This project reimplements the core functionality of [bibliometrix](https://github.com/massimoaria/bibliometrix) (developed by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo) using Python and the Shiny for Python framework, making these powerful bibliometric tools accessible to the Python scientific community.

Bibliometrics applies quantitative analysis and statistics to scientific publications and their citation patterns. It has become essential across all scientific fields for evaluating growth, maturity, leading authors, conceptual and intellectual maps, and emerging trends within research communities.

**bibliometrix-python** supports scholars in three key phases of analysis:

- **Data importing and conversion** from major bibliographic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Dimensions, Lens, Cochrane)

- **Bibliometric analysis** of publication datasets, including descriptive statistics, author productivity, and source impact

- **Building and visualizing networks** for co-citation, coupling, collaboration, and co-word analysis

## biblioshiny: Python Edition

**bibliometrix-python** includes an interactive web application built with **Shiny for Python**, providing an intuitive interface for comprehensive bibliometric analysis.

The web application enables scholars to easily access bibliometric analysis features through an interactive workflow:

### Data Management

- **Import and convert** data from multiple bibliographic databases via the
  source-agnostic ETL pipeline (`www/services/etl/`), which standardizes every
  source into the 24-column Web of Science schema:
  - Web of Science (plaintext, BibTeX, EndNote) - ✅ Supported
  - Scopus (CSV) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
  - Dimensions (Excel) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
  - PubMed (plaintext export) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
  - Lens.org (CSV) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
  - Cochrane CDSR (plaintext) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
  - OpenAlex / PubMed (live API query) - ✅ Supported (no manual download)

- **Filter data** by various criteria including publication years, languages, document types, citation counts, and Bradford's Law zones

- **Sample datasets** for testing and learning

### Analytics and Visualization

- **Three-level metrics** for comprehensive analysis:

  - **Sources**: journal performance, impact metrics, Bradford's Law, sources' local impact, production over time

  - **Authors**: productivity analysis, Lotka's Law, collaboration patterns, h-index, local impact, affiliations analysis

  - **Documents**: citation analysis, most relevant papers, references spectroscopy

- **Countries Analysis**: scientific production by country, collaboration networks, corresponding authors' countries

### Knowledge Structure Analysis

- **Conceptual Structure**: analyzing topics and themes through co-word analysis, thematic mapping, and thematic evolution

- **Intellectual Structure**: examining citation networks through co-citation analysis, historiograph, and document coupling

- **Social Structure**: exploring collaboration patterns through co-authorship networks at author, institution, and country levels

### Content Analysis Features

- **Word Analysis**: frequent words, word clouds, treemaps, word frequency over time

- **Trend Topics**: identify emerging and declining research topics

- **Three-Field Plot**: Sankey diagrams for exploring relationships between authors, keywords, and journals

### Advanced Features

- **AI-Powered Assistant**: Integrated Google Gemini AI chatbot for contextual help and insights - 🧪 BETA

- **Interactive Reports**: Generate comprehensive Excel reports combining multiple analyses

- **Export Capabilities**: Download plots as high-resolution images and tables as Excel files

### How to use biblioshiny

To launch the application, simply run:

```bash
shiny run app.py
```

Or using Python:

```bash
python -m shiny run app.py
```

The application will start and provide a local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) to access the web interface.

## Key Features

### Data Import and Processing

bibliometrix-python supports importing bibliographic data from major scientific
databases. A source-agnostic ETL pipeline (`www/services/etl/`) standardizes
each source into the Web of Science 24-column schema so the analytical functions
run unchanged:

- **Web of Science**: plaintext (.txt), BibTeX (.bib), EndNote (.ciw) - ✅ Supported
- **Scopus**: CSV (.csv) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
- **PubMed**: plaintext export (.txt) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
- **Dimensions**: Excel (.xlsx) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
- **Lens.org**: CSV (.csv) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
- **Cochrane**: plaintext (.txt) - ✅ Supported (ETL)
- **OpenAlex / PubMed**: live API query - ✅ Supported (pagination, retries, caching)

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for how to exercise each source and
[PROJECT_REPORT.md](PROJECT_REPORT.md) for the ETL architecture.
